A hello-world project mainly for trying out [Dropwizard](http://dropwizard.codahale.com/).

Also includes use of:

* [jax-rs-hateoas](http://code.google.com/p/jax-rs-hateoas/) which had to be hacked into Dropwizard a little bit.
* Groovy 2: just to see how the language has progressed since 1.x, not because it's utilised particularly well in this project.
